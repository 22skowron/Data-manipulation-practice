## Data manipulation pracitce

This repository contains various Jupyter Notebook files in which I practice working on data with Python modules such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.

The repository will surely grow over the next months, as I am driven to learn more about Machine Learning in Python.

Files in _"Course exercises - data science"_ directory come from the [**Python Bootcamp course on Udemy**](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code "https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code") and include multiple data-manipulation related tasks.

You can check out other projects completed during the course in [100 Days of Code Python Course](https://github.com/22skowron/100-Days-of-Code-Python-Course "https://github.com/22skowron/100-Days-of-Code-Python-Course") repo.
