## Data manipulation pracitce

This repository contains various Jupyter Notebook files in which I practice working on data with Python modules such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn and Plotly.

The repository will surely grow over the next months, as I am driven to learn more about Machine Learning in Python.

- Files in _"100 Days of Code The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"_ directory come from the [**Python Bootcamp course on Udemy**](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code "https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code") and include multiple data-manipulation related tasks.

- Files in _"Python for Data Science and Machine Learning"_ directory come from the [**Python for Data Science and Machine Learning course on Udemy**](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp "https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp") and include notebooks in which I practice econometrics in Python.
